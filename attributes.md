Compared to the other caster classes, the cleric has an interesting quirk: the class doesn't have access to an ability or a cantrip that enables a member of the class to attack using his wisdom modifier. This means that a cleric has to rely on spells to deal damage.

This is straightforward if you are playing on the paragon or epic tiers; if your character is above level 10, it's usually a waste to spend an action casting a cantrip, unless you are out of options. However, for characters in the lower levels, where spell resources are scarcer, you need to have an attack option; this also means that you'll have to choose strength or dexterity as secondary attribute, depending on whether the weapon's type is ranged or melee.

Do keep in mind that some domains are better suited to play strength; others are probably better at dexterity and sometimes you can do both. Additionally, there are options if you want to play pure wisdom builds and I feel that they are the most future-proof, but these are going to limit your character a bit (e.g. magic initiate requires to start as a variant human).

## strength

If your weapon of choice is a heavy and rolls for a good amount of damage or your domain offers access to heavy armor, then you'll generally want a bit of strength. Unfortunately, besides constitution, which doesn't have any skills linked to it, strength is next in line; only the athletics skills benefits from it. According to the saving throws statistical information, strength as a saving throw is pretty low, again: it's the fourth best, appearing in the player's handbook a total of 26 times. You can dump this attribute completely, or keep it at 10 if you don't want negative saving throw modifiers, or your dungeon master is strict with encumbrance.

If you are going to invest in strength depends a lot on the duration of the campaign; if you're a cleric with heavy armor proficiency in a short, apprentice tier campaign, then you'll want to start with a 13-14. You will most probably be in melee range so strength helps. You will be able to wear the armor, but if you don't fill the strength requirement, your speed is going to be reduced by 10ft. This doesn't seem to be much, but it is a hindrance when everyone else moves faster than you. If you don't want to invest in strength, there are some races that can help bypass this reduction - hill dwarves, wood elves and half-elves with wood elf ancenstry (from Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide). Hill dwarves have a speed of 25ft, but your speed is not reduced when wearing heavy armor. The suggested elves and half-elves have a base speed of 35ft due to the fleet of foot ability. After donning a suit of heavy armor for which you don't have the strength prerequisite, you get again 25ft.

For longer campaigns, especially if uncommon magic items will be available, you can safely dump strength; a suit of mithral full plate will save you from all your troubles and it doesn't require attunement.

## dexterity

Dexterity is a much important attribute in this edition of Dungeons \& Dragons, because it provides bonuses to armor class, initiative, attack with certain weapons, damage with certain weapons and the 'sneaky' skills: acrobatics, sleight of hand and stealth. Dexterity is the second most common saving throw, after wisdom, making it a good saving throw to keep high.

A dexterity of 14 and a suit of medium armor is a good combo for most clerics, especially if they don't have access to heavy armor and it's going to stay relevant for all your career; bonuses to initiative and saves are always welcome.

Remember that even though dexterity is associated with archery, you don't have to limit yourself to ranged weapons, due to the way finesse weapons work. The weapon with the most damage is the rapier (1d8), but there's also the whip which has reach.

The skills which are linked to the dexterity attribute are not that useful to a cleric.

## <blue>constitution</blue>

No skills are related to the constitution score, but it is the third best saving throw; dexterity appears more often, but the things that will be imposed on you if you fail are generally nastier if they warrant a constitution saving throw.

Another area where constitution helps is hit points, another important part - you are the guy who is going to keep the party up, which won't be possible if you're out.

Make sure to have a score of 12-14 in this attribute at minimum. If you can make room for it, it's a good idea to start with an odd number and pick up the resilient feat for constitution, which will make you also proficient with the saving throw.

## <red>intelligence</red>

Intelligence is an ability score that you can dump, since the only thing that it provides to a cleric build is the bonus to the intelligence skills (arcana, history, investigation, nature and religion). It appears rarely as a saving throw, so you can take your chances.

The only time that you should be considering raising it above 8-10 is if you want to multiclass to the wizard class, in which case you'll have to spare a score of 13.

## <navy>wisdom</navy>

Like dexterity, wisdom is a very good attribute for this edition of Dungeons \& Dragons. It boosts important skills like insight and perception and is a very common saving throw - it appears more times that any other attribute in the player's handbook, so it's important that clerics get proficiency in it.

If you are using point buy, you'll want to spend 9 points to get a 14-15 here, that'll be made into a 16 by selecting a suitable race. Then, spend the first two upgrades at level 4 and level 8 to bring it up to 20. This might be dull and uninteresting build, you can rarely go wrong with this spread. There's even room for a feat at level 1 with this if you go with the human variant as your race.

There are some ways available to use wisdom as a combat modifier, the most common of which is from the player's handbook and it involves getting a druid cantrip (shillelagh). There are a couple of possible ways to acquire this cantrip: multiclassing, picking the nature domain or picking the magic initiate feat.

## <red>charisma</red>

Unless you don't want the hit to the social skills, charisma is, like intelligence, an attribute that you can dump. Charisma saving throws are slightly less rare compared to the intelligence ones.
