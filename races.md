## <blue>hill dwarf</blue>

*player's handbook*

Hill dwarves are one of the few races that grant a bonus to wisdom, which is a very good thing to a cleric. The core dwarf traits increase your constitution by two points and the subrace adds one more hit point per level; since constitution increases just saving throws and hit points, it's safe to assume that the Hill Dwarf subrace almost provides +4 constitution and +1 wisdom, making it a very good defensive option.

Even though this subrace doesn't offer a bonus to a combat attribute, you can almost dump constitution (probably keep it to a pre-racially modifier 10) and increase the attribute of your choice. In the case that you choose a domain that doesn't offer proficiency with martial weapons, you can still go with strength as a combat stat, because the core dwarf traits offer proficiency with hammers and axes.

If you pick up the Life or the Nature domain, which offer heavy armor proficiency, remember that as a dwarf you don't care about armor strength requirements - normally, if you don't fulfill the requirement, that means that the armor imposes a 10ft speed reduction, but a dwarf's speed isn't reduced by wearing heavy armor. Multiclass spellcasters will benefit for this, as they can keep their armor class high while having low strength and dexterity scores in order to boost their mental stats.
With 24 points you can easily cover your combat attribute and max out your wisdom; keep the rest three points and spend them to dexterity, intelligence or charisma depending on what multiclass options you want to have open.

## mountain dwarf

*player's handbook*

Mountain dwarves may not provide a bonus to wisdom, but they do offer a +2 increase to both strength and constitution. This almost guarantees that your combat attribute is going to be strength, especially if you combine it with the core dwarf trait 'combat training', which offers proficiency with hammers and axes.
Unfortunately, Dwarven Armor Training, which provides you with light and medium armor proficiency goes to waste, since clerics already have proficiency with those armor types.

Since you don't receive a bonus to wisdom, you can go with a starting 14 and max it out at 12 level, or go with a 15 and choose a feat that increases your wisdom by 1 on one of your level-ups, like Observant, or take the +1/+1 attribute boost option.

## <red>high elf</red>

*player's handbook*

The racial bonuses of the high elf aren't the best for a cleric. Elf Weapon Training provides access to bows, which coupled with the dexterity bonus that all elves receive makes for a good combat setup; other subraces offer a similar weapon selection though.

The bonus cantrip may be a good option if more cantrips are introduced, but currently, due to the way spell attacks work, you won't be able to use most of them reliably, unless you increase your intelligence. You're better off choosing a cantrip that offers utility, but doing that isn't going to give your character an important combat edge.

Pump both dexterity and wisdom to a pre-racial 15 in order to increase both at the earliest to an even number and then continue maxing out your wisdom (which will most probably happen at 12th level). Alternatively you can keep dexterity to 14 and select a feat that increases your wisdom score, like Observant.

## <blue>wood elf</blue>

*player's handbook*

The wood elf is a very good fit if you want to play a dexterity focused cleric, as choosing this race increases your dexterity and wisdom scores. Wood elves are in many ways mechanically similar to hill dwarves, but with a dexterity focus instead of constitution.

As with high elves, getting Elf Weapon Training is going to be especially useful for clerics that do not choose Tempest or War as a domain and thus won't receive martial weapon proficiencies.

Fleet of Foot is quite straightforward, but also note that it has the same results if you choose to wear heavy armor without meeting the strength requirement, thus bringing your walking speed to 25feet. As with dwarves, choosing a domain that gives you heavy armor proficiency and disregarding strength requirements could be an option.
Mask of the Wild is, unfortunately, a stealth buff, which isn't going to be that useful to a cleric.

## drow

*player's handbook*

What I dislike most about this subrace is that's the only one that actually has a built-in disadvantage on important rolls (attacks and perception); this isn't balanced by the additional spells that drows receive via their Drow Magic ability, especially since they're charisma-based.

This fact aside though, if you're planning to create a dexterity-focused cleric and want to pick a domain that doesn't offer martial weapon proficiency, drows can really work, as they get proficiency with rapiers and hand crossbows - the first is the highest damage finesse weapon and the latter is a light ranged weapon, usable in the offhand.

The charisma bonus could be useful, too, if you're planning to multiclass to bard, sorcerer or warlock (more on this on the multiclassing session).

## lightfoot halfling

*player's handbook*

Halfling is another race which hints that your combat focus should be dexterity. Unfortunately they don't get any racial proficiencies like elves do and instead receive a defensive ability (Brave) and Lucky.

Naturally Stealthy is a stealth buff and while it won't be that useful to a cleric, you can use it regularly when you're next to teammates; Halfling Nimbleness helps in that regard, too.

The charisma bonus could be useful, if you're planning to multiclass to bard, sorcerer or warlock (more on this on the multiclassing session).

## stout halfling

*player's handbook*

This subrace gets a constitution increase and Stout Resilience, an ability that gives you advantage on saving throws against poison and resistance against poison damage, making them really similar to dwarves.

Lucky, the ability to re-roll 1's on attack rolls, ability checks or saving throws is a good enough reason to pick the halfling over a dwarf, if you don't mind going with dexterity as a secondary attribute.

## <blue>human</blue>

*player's handbook*

While other races have a big ability that make them appealing and unique, the human race offers a single point increase in all ability scores. This means that their unique ability is actually multiclassing, as they can spend their attribute points optimally in order to support different classes and weird builds.

You can spend your attribute points evenly and get five 13s and one 10, which will be increased to 14. Alternatively you can get a single 15 in wisdom, support three 13s and still have some leftover points.

If you don't plan to multiclass to a class that has a strength requirement, like the fighter class and obviously you don't want to go with strength as your secondary combat attribute, you can put any points left there - it's the only attribute that gives you essential bonuses when it's not even (it increases your carrying capacity).

[27 point buy] 8/13/11/13/15/13 -> 9/14/12/14/16/14
[27 point buy] 8/13/13/13/14/13 -> 9/14/14/14/15/14
[27 point buy] 10/13/13/13/13/13 -> 11/14/14/14/14/14

## <navy>variant human</navy>

*player's handbook*

The normal human race is a multiclassing expert, but the variant human is able to choose his unique ability, making him the king of utility - it's only going to get better with every added sourcebook.

Heavy Armor Master is very good at low levels if you want to focus on strength; high armor, damage reduction plus some healing through the cleric class is going to make you very durable. As this feat requires heavy armor proficiency, this is only useful with Nature, Life, Tempest or War domain.

Magic Initiate gives you not one, but two cantrips from the spellcasting class that you select. This feat is golden with the druid class, which shares wisdom as a casting attribute: the best choice is Shillelagh, enabling you to completely disregard strength and dexterity as a combat attribute; additionally, you can also get Produce Flame as a means to get a ranged attack, albeit with a short range or Thorn Whip, which does a bit less damage, but gives you some crowd control ability, since you can drag large or smaller creatures towards you. You also get a single first level spell, which can be used on Animal Friendship (has 24 hour duration and gives you a free animal companion) or Goodberry (creates 10 berries that if consumed provide enough nourishment for the day).

By picking Observant you can start with a +2 on your wisdom attribute; currently, there's no race that provides a +2 bonus to wisdom, so there's some value in this feat based on this fact alone. The +5 to passive perception and passive investigation scores is also quite valuable.

Clerics that somehow pick up Shillelagh will love the Polearm Master feat, because both abilities work with a quarterstaff. You can get both from level 1 if you selected the Nature domain. The feat not only enables you to get another attack as a bonus action, but also spend your reaction on opportunity attacks when a creature enters your reach (something that's not normally possible).

Ritual Caster for the Wizard class (which has the highest number of [Ritual] spells), is also a good idea and since you will already have wisdom score of 13 or higher, you don't need to boost your intelligence; [Ritual] spells generally don't require saving throws that you'd care about. This is also a good way of acquiring the Find Familiar spell without multiclassing to the wizard class.

War Caster is useful if you want to keep a shield and you can cast a spell with your reaction; unfortunately the spell must target specifically the creature that provoked an opportunity attack from you, so you'll have to memorize appropriate spells to set this up. This feat is very good if it's combined with Polearm Master, because through that feat you get an additional method of receiving opportunity attacks.

## <red>dragonborn</red>

*player's handbook*

Compared to other more common races, the Dragonborn seems to be a little lackluster: it boosts strength and charisma, but also gets Breath Weapon, which has a constitution based saving throw; this combined with the fact that you'll want to max out your wisdom already makes you suffer from multiple attribute dependency, so it's not going to work easily.

The only notable mention is that there's some synergy with Tempest clerics and dragonborns with a lightning damage breath weapon, as they can maximize one breath attack per short rest and also benefit from the Tempest cleric's martial weapon and heavy armor proficiencies, since they get a +2 strength bonus. This combination is OK during the low levels, but spells will quickly make the Breath Weapon obsolete and will be better candidates for Destructive Wrath.

## <red>forest gnome</red>

*player's handbook*

There isn't much synergy between forest gnomes and the cleric class besides the dexterity bonus that they receive and even then, there are better races if you want to focus on that as a combat attribute. Getting Minor Illusion for free unfortunately isn't going to cut it.

At least Gnome Cunning is a nice ability to have, especially since you have proficiency in wisdom and charisma saving throws from the cleric class.

## <red>rock gnome</red>

*player's handbook*

As with forest gnomes, this subrace doesn't offer much to the cleric class and doesn't even have a dexterity bonus, but a constitution one; at least dexterity-focused forest gnomes have the option to begin with a 16 in dexterity, but rock gnomes can't do this.

I like the fluff that the Tinker ability has, but it doesn't offer anything mechanically concrete.

## <blue>half-elf</blue>

*player's handbook*

I view the half-elf race as a human subrace that trades some of its attribute bonuses for skill choices and minor goodies like darkvision. Since this race is similar to human, its primary function is multiclassing, albeit with a more specific focus to classes that have charisma requirements and/or benefit from charisma, like bard, sorcerer and warlock.

## <blue>half-orc</blue>

*player's handbook*

If you wish to play a strength focused cleric, half-orcs are quite possibly the best choice after the variant human, as they get strength and constitution bonuses. Relentless Endurance is nice to have as a cleric - if you are required to cure someone, it's best if you can stay up to do so.

Savage Attacks is great with weapons that have a large damage dice, like d12, so make sure to get a domain that provides martial weapon proficiencies, like War or Tempest.

## <red>tiefling</red>

*player's handbook*

Unfortunately, this race doesn't have any selling points. Just compare them to the dragonborn, a race that's already quite bad for a cleric, but does pump a combat attribute, gives you resistance to a form of elemental damage and also gives you an alternative way to deal damage - a breath weapon. By choosing tiefling as your race you just get resistance, the Thaumaturgy cantrip (which you can already get from cleric levels) and a couple of spells that will be quickly out-leveled - Hellish Rebuke as a 2nd level spell and Darkness.

You could use the tiefling race if you wanted a weird multiclass combination that involved wizard and a charisma-based casting class, but this isn't anything the human or half-elf race wouldn't be able to handle.
