Hello and welcome to the Cleric guide for D&D 5e.

In the following guide I will be using the color coding that I introduced during the days of 3.5e in the wizards' of the coast optimization forum. Unfortunately that guide is now lost, because the forum is defunct, but a forum poster named Clockwerk66 has posted it [here](http://www.enworld.org/forum/showthread.php?471718-Handbook-to-Guide-Writing-(Dictum_Mortuum)). Normally, I prefer three colors and a fourth one that's there to denote the best choices.

- <navy>**navy**</navy>: this is a no-brainer. I use this sparingly.
- <blue>**blue**</blue>: this is a good choice. I use this more often.
- **black**: this is ok. Most items fall into this category.
- <red>**red**</red>: this is bad. I use this often.

The character optimization community has picked up the color coding technique and it is now used in almost every optimization guide on the Internet, but every time I feel that people are not using it correctly.

My first issue, is too many colors. Three is easy to keep in your head. Some people are using 5 or 6 colors and this makes me scroll between the color code explanation and the item that I'm currently reading. Often, the order doesn't make any sense, too: recently I was reading a guide where best was yellow, orange was next to worst and red was worst, but orange, yellow and red are really close in the color scale!

My second issue is lack of sufficient explanation. I'm guilty of this myself a lot of times - sometimes the guide writer grades an item with a color, but the explanation is different - e.g. bad items described positively, which puts the reader off.

My third and final issue is not picking colors that are friendly to colorblind people. I am colorblind myself and I can't distinguish between green and red fonts - larger areas are much easier to figure out the color, but fonts requires a lot of concentration and I'm still not 100% sure. This is why I chose blue, red and navy for those rare class staples - they are easy to read (compared to yellow or light green fonts) and work for everyone, even colorblind people!

Additionally, I will be using the following tier levels to describe builds or campaigns:
- Apprentice tier (level 1-4).
- Expert tier (level 5-10).
- Paragon tier (level 11-16).
- Epic tier (level 17-20).

# the many-faced class

Among the basic classes from the Player's Handbook, the cleric has the most thematic freedom. By selecting the correct divine domain you can be a holy warrior, much like a paladin, a roguish trickster, a blaster or a good ol' heal bot. The best part is that domains only offer abilities that have a positive impact on your core, meaning that you won't have, for instance, less spells per day for selecting the Light domain over the War domain; you might get bonus skills, armor and exclusive abilities, but not at the cost of your main kit.

When playing a cleric, **use the diversity that if offered by divine domains**: try to figure out the weaknesses of your party and help by selecting a domain that could be of assistance.

Remember that clerics of different domains could potentially follow the same deity. It all depends on the god's portfolio, so be open-minded when making associations. Pelor is the god of sun, so it'll be mostly light clerics who follow him, but he's also the god of healing, so life clerics could exist among his followers, too; but, if you wanted to play something akin to a paladin of Pelor, then war domain would work, too.

# the common denominator

While the divine domains is the class feature that takes clerics apart, spells is what binds them together. Every cleric is a conduit of the divine; he is able to manifest his god's power into spells from the cleric spell list. This list is the same for all clerics, with minor differences, most often because of their domain selection.

If I could do a TL;DR version of this guide, it would probably be the following: **Before making any important decision for your character, ask yourself: does this hurt my spellcasting ability?**

Remember that you are a full caster: your number one priority as a character is the god-given ability to manipulate the divine power of the gods. **Don't be carried away by your theme, it's there to add fluff, synergy and variety, it's not meant to be built upon.** Of course, there are always exceptions to this rule, but they are rare. If you are faced with a feat choice - e.g. "should I grab Heavy Armor Master for my life cleric, or should I put that +2 to my wisdom?", the safest choice is the one that improves your wisdom and your spellcasting.

# hit point statistics & healing

This edition of dungeons and dragons has a number of good features that were designed correctly and elegantly. Sky's the limit, however, regarding attributes, the sky caps out at 20 for player characters.

We know that the highest hit die in the game is d12 and the lowest d6. Additionally, due to the well-defined boundaries that the game has set on attributes, we know that the lowest constitution is 8 and the highest 20. All these mean that we can accurately calculate the lowest and the highest number of hit points for any character.

But doing these calculations by hand is complicated, because they include dice rolls. For this reason I've written a program for the anydice site that makes these calculations easier. If you visit [this](http://anydice.com/program/c941) link and press the calculate button, you will get a graph representation of the output of the program that I've written. The program calculates the average number of hit points for all levels; the answer is a bit less than 9 hit points per level.

With that information in hand, you can now determine the potency of your healing spells; if you heal someone for 20 hit points, you're giving your ally a bit more than two levels of hit points back.

# the healer's dilemma

Among the roleplaying groups that I have encountered, there are some people that view the cleric as a dedicated heal bot. Even though I am not a fan of MMORPGs, I think that this is the source of this opinion, that the character who heals should only do that and little else.

However, MMOs and tabletop games are fundamentally different. In D&D, full casters are among the best classes due to their utility. The cleric's role is that of the support - do anything in your power to buff your teammates and debuff your enemies.

I am not suggesting that you shouldn't be healing people - you should pick up the healer's role, since you do have access to all the healing spells - cure wounds, healing word, mass cure wounds, mass healing word, heal; what I'm saying is **do not reduce your combat role to those 5 spells**. You do have others, which are powerful.

This is the healer's dilemma - do you spend your action casting a powerful spell that will hinder your enemies, or do you save an ally from dying? Thankfully, in 5th edition, being at 0 hit points doesn't mean that you're immediately dead, so if an ally is down, he can wait one round if he's not fired upon, or two if he succeeds on the death saving throw.

Remember that the combat ends when your enemies are all dead or fleeing. Each action that you take against your enemies is one action closer to the end of the battle. The fighting ability of your allies is the same whether they have 10 or 100 hit points remaining.

Bottom line: buff your allies and bring them back from 0 hit points; focus on debuffing your enemies.

# prepare healing word, avoid cure wounds

Cure wounds doesn't stand a chance compared to healing word and you should be questioning if it's worth the slot to prepare it for the day.

First of all, if both are casted as first level spells, their average hit point difference is just 2.  If you are still not convinced, I've created another [program](http://anydice.com/program/c971) with the anydice calculator that shows that as first level spells, healing word will outperform or heal equally to cure wounds 31.25% of the time. Since we know that the average difference is 2 however, the percentage that of casts that cure wounds will outdo healing word by up to 2 is 56.25%, which means that is higher than half of the times. The same numbers drop to 17.58% and 34.57% when both spells are level 2, however, at least for out of combat healing, you are better off casting prayer of healing.

Even though you are getting less healing from healing word, albeit, based on the paragraph above, only 68.75% of the time, this is the only aspect where cure wounds is superior. Cure wounds is a touch spell, which means that you have to touch the creature to benefit from it; allies that are out of reach cannot receive any healing from it; this is not the case with healing word, which has a range of 60ft and its only restriction is that you have to see the subject. Additionally, cure wounds has a casting time of 1 action, while healing word is a bonus action.

These two differences, the range and the casting time are what make healing word the better spell. If you choose cure wounds you will have to go out of your way to help a dying ally - move near him and spend an action to heal him, unless you are standing next to him. On the other hand, healing word not only does not have this restriction - you won't have to break your positioning unless your opponent is really far away from the battlefield - but, you are then free to cast a cantrip or attack, which is you taking steps towards the end of an encounter.

Mass cure wounds is a lot better, since it's not a touch spell, but I still consider mass healing word the better spell, as it's available from level 5 and it is still a bonus action.
