- *player's handbook*
- *the ability to cast at least one spell*

You are most probably going to be a frontline caster and all of these abilities are very useful to those that want to cast in melee range. The first ability is perfect, since most of your good buffs are going to be concentration; if you manage to get proficiency in constitution saves somehow, this is going to be even better. The second ability is useful to those that are not going to go with the rules clarification presented by the designers and affix the divine focus on your shield and want to have both hands full with something; this is also the go-to feat to take if you want to play a cleric that dual-wields weapons. Finally, the last ability enables you to forgo your attack of opportunity in order to cast a spell on that creature; this ability needs some setup, as you have to memorize offensive spells that meet certain criteria (single target and casting time of 1 action), but considering that you're a full caster, your spells will generally have a greater impact than a single attack of opportunity.
