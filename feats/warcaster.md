- *player's handbook*
- *the ability to cast at least one spell*

One of the best feats for a frontline caster. If you want to be casting spells in melee range, then it's a good idea to pick up this feat at level 4.

Some of your best buffing spells are concentration. The first ability gives you advantage on constitution saving throw to maintain concentration spells when you take damage, which is very important. If you manage to fit in your build the feat Resilient on your constitution, then you'll have advantage and proficiency on concentration saves (since they're constitution-based), not to mention that wisdom and constitution are two of the most important proficiencies to possess.

The second ability enables you to perform the somatic components of spells even when you have weapons or a shield in one or both hands. All clerics have shield and medium armor proficiency, so this is applicable to all domains. Now according to the [rules clarifications](http://dmdavid.com/tag/9-more-fifth-edition-dd-rules-questions-answered-by-the-designers/) that have been provided by the game's designers, a divine focus can be emblazoned on a cleric's shield, enabling the cleric to wield a weapon, a shield and still cast spells. This means that clerics without this feat cannot cast spells with somatic components without stowing their weapon first.

Finally, the last ability enables you to forgo your attack of opportunity in order to cast a spell on that creature; this ability needs some setup, as you have to memorize offensive spells that meet certain criteria (single target and casting time of 1 action), but considering that you're a full caster, your spells will generally have a greater impact than a single attack of opportunity. Some good picks would be guiding bolt or hold person.
