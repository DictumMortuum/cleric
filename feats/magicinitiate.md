- *player's handbook*

This gives you not one, but two cantrips from the spellcasting class that you select. This feat is golden with the druid class, which shares wisdom as a casting attribute: the best choice is Shillelagh, enabling you to completely disregard strength and dexterity as a combat attribute; additionally, you can also get Produce Flame as a means to get a ranged attack, albeit with a short range or Thorn Whip, which does a bit less damage, but gives you some crowd control ability, since you can drag large or smaller creatures towards you. You also get a single first level spell, which can be used on Animal Friendship (has 24 hour duration and gives you a free animal companion) or Goodberry (creates 10 berries that if consumed provide enough nourishment for the day).
