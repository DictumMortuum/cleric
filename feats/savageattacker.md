- *player's handbook*

This is like having advantage on weapon damage rolls alone. While it's a neat ability to have, it doesn't offer any solid results and it largely depends on the damage die of your chosen weapon: if it's something like d8 or d6, then you should really don't bother at all; however you can get more mileage from this if you get something like a maul (2d6) or battleaxe (d12).
