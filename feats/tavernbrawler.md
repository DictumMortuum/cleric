# tavern brawler

- *player's handbook*

Really useful if you want to make a grappler, this can work if you can cast spells while grappling. A grappled creature has effectively zero speed, which isn't the best condition around, but it's quite good if you want to keep an enemy in place. Do note that you're probably have to get your strength score up and gain proficiency in athletics.
