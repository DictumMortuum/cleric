- *player's handbook*
- *intelligence or wisdom 13 or higher*

Ritual Caster for the Wizard class (which has the highest number of [Ritual] spells), is also a good idea and since you will already have wisdom score of 13 or higher, you don't need to boost your intelligence; [Ritual] spells generally don't require saving throws that you'd care about. This is also a good way of acquiring the Find Familiar spell without multiclassing to the wizard class.
