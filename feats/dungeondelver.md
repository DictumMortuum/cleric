# dungeon delver

*player's handbook*

This feat isn't average - the abilities provided are actually quite interesting, but the problem is that it's quite situational and depends heavily on the type of the adventure your dungeon master is running. If you're planning on being the party scout, then pick it, probably combined with a background that grants you access to thieves' tools.
