# mage slayer

- *player's handbook*

If you are going to be a melee combatant, the benefits granted by this feat are overall great - extra attack as a reaction, advantage on saving throws and chance to screw up opponent spellcasters' concentration checks by imposing disadvantage on the roil.

It's a pitty that these abilities work when the enemy spellcaster is within 5 feet of you and not within your reach - that way reach weapons could be a lot more useful.
