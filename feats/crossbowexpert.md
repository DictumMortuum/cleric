*player's handbook*

Only useful for clerics that focus on dexterity; since you do not gain additional attacks on your attack action, the first ability isn't that useful - you will only attack once with each hand crossbow - unless you have chosen the War domain. The second and third abilities are useful if you want to use a hand crossbow in the off-hand.
