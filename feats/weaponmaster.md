# <red>weapon master</red>

- *player's handbook*

The cleric class already has two domains that grant proficiency with all martial weapons; in addition to that, there are certain races that grant weapon proficiencies, like dwarves and elves. If you're considering getting this feat, then for some reason you have to avoid getting weapon proficiencies through your domain and race, but you also think that a certain weapon or two are absolutely integral to your character build; unfortunately no martial weapon is worth delaying the upgrade to your wisdom bonus and most of the times the difference in damage is about 2-3 points on average.

The boost to your strength or dexterity is a nice selling point, but there are feats that offer better abilities than some weapon proficiencies.
