# <red>healer</red>

- *player's handbook*

You should only be considering this if you have to do a lot of healing at low levels and you don't want to choose the Life domain, as 10 uses of a 1d6+4 hit point healing at only 5gp is great. As you get enough levels this feature will be horribly underwhelming.

Do note that the fact that each creature can only receive the benefit of the healer feat only once per long or short rest contributes greatly to the reduction of this feat's potential.
