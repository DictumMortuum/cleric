# <red>spell sniper</red>

- *player's handbook*

Useful to Light domain clerics that regularly use Scorching Ray or to clerics that really like Guiding Bolt. The bonuses are solid, however due to the lack of spells in the cleric spell list that benefit from them, this isn't very good.

This feat may prove to be better if you're a multiclass character or just looking to use a different combat attribute from strength or dexterity, for instance picking eldritch blast for your cantrip and focusing on Charisma as a secondary combat stat seems to be OK.
