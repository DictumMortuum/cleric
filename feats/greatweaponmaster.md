# greater weapon master

- *player's handbook*

This has great synergy with War clerics, because of their Channel Divinity special feature that gets them to add a +10 bonus - but after they've seen their die roll. As long as you've got Channel Divinity uses, then you can keep using the feat's second option and benefit of a +10 damage bonus consistently.

The first ability doesn't have exceptional synergy for a War cleric, but if it triggers it does save you War Priest uses per day, which is a good thing.

Most of the other domains wouldn't benefit greatly from Great Weapon Master - they need to be using a heavy weapon and all of them are martial, so that leaves only multiclassing or the Tempest domain, not the most synergistic options.
