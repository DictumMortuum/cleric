# <red>heavily armored</red>

- *player's handbook*
- *proficiency with medium armor*

If you want to play a cleric in heavy armor, there is a large number of domain options available, as this proficiency is provided by Nature, Life, War and Tempest domains.

If you want to be a heavily armored member of Knowledge, Light or Trickery domain and you want to boost your strength instead of your dexterity score, then you can consider this feat, but it isn't the greatest idea.
