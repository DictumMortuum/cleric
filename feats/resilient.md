- *player's handbook*

As with Observant, get this in order to start with a +2 to wisdom with a variant human, or in order to even out your wisdom score if you started with a score of 15.
You can also use this on constitution, in order to gain proficiency with constitution saves, which is going to help a lot for your concentration spells. Alternatively, if you're planning to multiclass, it's good to start your build with a class that grants constitution save proficiency and then get Resilient on Wisdom.
