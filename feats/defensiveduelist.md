# defensive duelist

- *player's handbook*
- *dexterity 13 or higher*

Adding your proficiency bonus to your armor class against attacks is a pretty good ability - even from level 1, it's like you're wielding an additional shield and it gets better with levels. You've got unlimited uses, but the feat is kinda narrow, as you can only use it with finesse weapons, which means that you're probably focusing on dexterity, and it applies only against melee attacks - you can't dodge ranged attacks.
