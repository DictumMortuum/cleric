# <blue>polearm master</blue>

- *player's handbook*

Clerics that somehow pick up Shillelagh will love the Polearm Master feat, because both abilities work with a quarterstaff. You can get both from level 1 if you selected the Nature domain. The feat not only enables you to get another attack as a bonus action, but also spend your reaction on opportunity attacks when a creature enters your reach (something that's not normally possible).

I would rate this feat navy, if it wasn't for its dependency on Shillelagh.
