Since this feat provides temporary hit points that is based on your level plus your charisma modifier, it's a quite good source of extra durability; you can use it after having a short rest, which makes the feat's value even better.

The only problem is the charisma requirement, which, unless you're a half-elf or a human, won't be that easy to meet.
