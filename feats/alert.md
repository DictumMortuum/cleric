*player's handbook*

Receive a quite large bonus to initiative and two situational abilities when you're surprised. The thing here is that while the benefits are good, they are passive and you generally don't care that much to begin your turn before your opponents, like Assassins do. If you're thinking of acquiring this feat, do it after you've maxed out your main casting attribute.
