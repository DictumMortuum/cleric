# heavy armor master

- *player's handbook*
- *proficiency with heavy armor*

A front-liner cleric of the War, Life, Nature or Tempest domain would benefit greatly from this feat during the early levels, especially against multiple enemies that do not deal heavy damage; the character can be exceptionally durable, since he has the ability to cure himself of damage, too.

The feat also increases your strength, providing extra melee synergy.
