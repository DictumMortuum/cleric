# <blue>sentinel</blue>

- *player's handbook*

Like Mage Slayer, this is a feat for melee clerics. The abilities granted by the feat are really solid and synergistic, for instance, it enables you to hit creatures with opportunity attacks, even if they used the disengage action and if you manage to hit them, they are unable to continue their movement. Sentinel has very good lockdown potential.
