The ranged counterpart to Great Weapon Master, this has great synergy with War clerics, because of their Channel Divinity special feature that gets them to add a +10 bonus - but after they've seen their die roll. As long as you've got Channel Divinity uses, then you can keep using the feat's third option and benefit of a +10 damage bonus consistently.

If you've chosen to fight with dexterity, this is a very good pick, as it also removes the disadvantage that you normally get when firing shots at long range and you also ignore half cover and three-quarters cover. For longbow users, this means that you can start fighting at 600feet, which can be deadly - a theoretical opponent with 100ft speed equipped with a longbow has to spend 5 rounds to get close if he wants to fire shots without disadvantage.
