# <red>dual wielder</red>

*player's handbook*

Two weapon fighting doesn't have enough synergy with spellcasting classes. First of all, it eats up your bonus action, which can be used to cast spells (probably of the kind that enhances combat abilities) and use your normal action to attack or cast a cantrip. If you've got both of your hands full you will be unable hold on to material components or wield your deity's holy symbol, so you won't have the ability to cast spells with material components. Finally, if you use your action to cast a spell, dual wielding is almost useless, as you need to use the attack action in order to attack with your off-hand.
