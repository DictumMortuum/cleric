- *the ability to cast at least one spell*

Light is the only domain that would benefit of picking up this feat, using the fire option; it enables your blasts to avoid minimum damage and ignore resistance.
It's an option for clerics of the Tempest domain as well, but it doesn't seem like a good idea; they have a dual element focus on lightning and thunder, and Tempest clerics tend to also use weapons in order to deal damage. Finally, this feat only works on spells and Tempests do have some special abilities that won't benefit from this feat.
