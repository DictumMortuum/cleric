# <red>medium armor master</red>

- *player's handbook*
- *proficiency with medium armor*

Basically, if your dexterity score is 16 or higher, you've got to spend a feat slot for +1 AC. If you are interested in stealth, you're spending a feat slot for +2 AC. In both examples, compare the half-plate (15+dex AC, imposes disadvantage on stealth rolls) to breastplate (14+dex AC, no disadvantage).
