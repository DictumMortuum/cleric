## chassis

There's not much here that stands out, aside from the great saves: low hit points, acceptable proficiencies and small skills list.

Clerics receive light armor, medium armor and shields proficiency. Higher AC is welcome, especially during apprentice and expert tiers, as it is able to mitigate some blows.

Clerics are also proficient with all simple weapons, which are more than enough. Spells will quickly outclass a cleric's damage output through weapons, anyway.

Hit points are low for a class that can potentially be in the front line, but it's not the worst and cleric is a full caster. Thankfully, clerics do get armor and shield proficiencies.

The highlight of the cleric's core is without a doubt their saves: wisdom and charisma. Wisdom is a strong saving throw proficiency, because it appears quite often as a save. Charisma isn't as popular, but it is used to avoid some quite debilitating effects.

The rest of the proficiencies are lackluster: no tools and a small list of skills, which includes history, insight, medicine, persuasion and religion.

## <blue>Channel Divinity</blue>

While the usefulness of this ability depends a lot on your chosen domain, because turn undead is situational, it is solid. First of all, you replenish all your uses of channel divinity after a short rest even from level 2, the level at which you acquire this ability. This provides the class with some lasting power. Additionally, a second charge of this ability is gained early on the expert tier, at level 6.

Turn undead is a thematic, but also quite the situational ability. It's nice to have, especially at the apprentice and expert tiers. It affects all undead within 30ft of you and can possibly disable multiple enemies, preventing you and your party from being overrun by hordes of undead.

## destroy undead

Destroy instead of turning undead creatures if their challenge rating is low enough, scaling according to your level. It's a nice upgrade to your default Channel Divinity, but nothing special; it's an ability that will make your life easier clearing large amounts of undead mooks.

## divine intervention

Have you ever been in such a situation, either in- or out-of-combat that no matter what you did would make little difference? This is an ability for those times, giving you a last ditch effort for a deus ex machina to resolve the situation. The ability is vague on purpose, but unfortunately it has little chance of success (10% when you first acquire it) and for a good enough reason, otherwise it would be trivially used.
