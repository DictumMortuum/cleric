- *player's handbook*
- *concentration*

This is too situational to be of any help, as you have to choose the correct saving throw out of the six available ones and even then, it's a concentration buff. At least you can see the die roll before expending the abjuration in order to get a bonus d4 to it.

Outside of combat, if you know that your actions are going to require a specific saving throw roll on your part, then it's worth it, but those situations do not come up often.
