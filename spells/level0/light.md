# light

- *player's handbook*

Nothing special - it's basically a way to see in the dark when your race doesn't have darkvision, which is quite rare to be honest.

There is some utility to the spell, but it's undermined by the fact that it automatically ends when you cast it again; its most useful function is to point at targets when you can't communicate or for co-ordination - I like casting Light on the feathers of an arrow beforehand and shooting at targets, making obvious where they are, especially in the dark. The fact that you can color the light as you like gives you some options, too - shooting colored arrows is almost like using flares.
