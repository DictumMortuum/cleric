# light

- *player's handbook*

Nothing special - it's basically a way to see in the dark when your race doesn't have darkvision, which is quite rare to be honest.

Light can be used for utility and it's exceptionaly good at this, especially if you've communicated the signals to your teammates beforehand. Remember that you can select the color of the light, but the spell automatically ends when you cast it again, so it's only one at the time.

I like casting light on ammunition and then shooting them. You can signal help, danger, or even give the position of enemies. You can even coordinate with your allies, especially if the party is split.

Another way of using light is casting it on pebbles and throwing them in places that are too dark. If you want to investigate an underground corridor, it's a good idea to throw a rock (or use a sling!) at the end of it. Sure, some attention may be drawn to it, but you can prepare and get some round or two of free attacks.
