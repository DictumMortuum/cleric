- *player's handbook*

Currently this is the only ranged attack cantrip that the cleric class and to be honest, I don't like it at all, however, it's scaling damage, you can use it with War Caster if you picked the feat up and, finally, as you gain levels, certain enemies might have higher armor classes than dexterity save scores.
