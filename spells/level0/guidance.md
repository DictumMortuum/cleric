- *player's handbook*
- *concentration*

Gives your next skill check a +1d4 bonus. This is an awesome cantrip that gives a +2 bonus on average on every skill check you'll made; it's not that simple of course, since casting this in battle doesn't seem to be a very good idea, but it's very cost-effective, considering your investment. I'd rate it navy, but unfortunately, Guidance is a concentration cantrip, meaning that if you want to keep a concentration buff (probably in-between battles) and also receive this benefit then you won't be able to without losing your first spell.
