# mending

- *player's handbook*

Even though there are far better cantrips, mending has a lot of utility uses that can be used to either cover your tracks, repair tools and weapons, or deliver secret messages.

You can use it to hide items (small weapons or valuables) inside a broken hollow item. After a cast of mending, there is no way that other people will access it. The same is possible for delivering secret messages; this technique is especially powerful if you have agreed to this method with the receiving party beforehand.

Even the most seasoned adventurers are sometimes clumsy. You could use mending to cover your tracks by mending broken items. If you are passing through a forest you could also cast mending on broken twigs.

If your DM is picky about the durability of tools and weapons, then a party member could pick this up.
