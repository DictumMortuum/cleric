# <blue>animate dead</blue>

- *player's handbook*

Create zombies or skeletons, depending on what you're choosing to animate: pile of bones or a corpse.
Getting undead servants isn't going to be a thing for all clerics, but they do have great utility. Unfortunately their stats are unimpressive, so either get skeletons and use them as a firing squad, as they can use bows, or use zombies that can take some hits and survive.

As you gain levels the servants will be useless in battle, but they can use the help action, which will give your teammates advantage on attacks; make sure to give the mental command to each undead separately before the battle, otherwise you'll have to keep spending your bonus actions on commands, which isn't optimal.

Animate Dead scales very good, as it gives you control or animates two additional creatures per slot above 3rd - that's three creatures using a 4th level slot, which is handy, as keeping four undead creatures at low levels consumes your spell slots.
