# bane

- *player's handbook*
- *concentration*

Bane is a respectable debuff and one of the few spells that call for charisma saves. At low levels, this is like stripping your enemies' proficiency bonus and it applies to three creatures right from the start. The main problem that I have with spells that require saving throws is that it sucks when they are negated; affecting three creatures at once however increases your chances to affect at least one of them.

As you gain levels you will have access to better concentration spells, the debuff that Bane imposes will be easier to be dealt with by your enemies and casting this from a higher spell slot increases the amount of creatures that you can affect - not the actual debuff. Bottom line, it doesn't scale that well.
