- *player's handbook*
- *concentration*

One of the best concentration spells that you will ever receive is Bless and the fact that it's available only to the Cleric and Paladin classes make it your responsibility to provide it to the party. For quite a few levels, there will rarely be better spells to cast during your first round of battle.

Bless also scales quite good - don't be afraid of heightening it to affect as many members of your party as possible.
