# command

- *player's handbook*

Another respectable debuff that calls for a wisdom save, however it doesn't work on undead or if the creature can't understand your language - I guess your best bet is using common here.
Most of the available choices in the description of the spell mess up a creature's actions, so make sure you choose the one that is most applicable.

Command at higher levels enables you to affect multiple creatures, which means that the spell actually scales quite well. You can also use the spell with War Caster.
