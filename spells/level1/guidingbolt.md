# <blue>guiding bolt</blue>

- *player's handbook*

Guiding Bolt is probably one of the top spells that you can use your first level spell slots on; it packs a lot of punch at 4d6 radiant damage and it also gives advantage on the next attack roll against the target.

The spell has long range and it lacks material components, but unfortunately it doesn't scale good into the higher levels.
