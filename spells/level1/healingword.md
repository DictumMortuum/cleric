# <navy>healing word</navy>

- *player's handbook*

Healing Word is the best choice for in-combat healing at low levels. It takes only a bonus action to cast, so you can use your action for attacking or using a cantrip and you can also cast it from a 60ft range - you don't have to touch your subject like Cure Wounds requires.

All these come at the cost of healing 1d4 instead of 1d8 hit points - it might seem like a big difference, but it's only 2 hit points on average. Those two hit point cost completely warrant the trade off.
