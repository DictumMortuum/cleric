# inflict wounds

- *player's handbook*

The damage is quite good for the first few levels, but as you gain levels it will quickly lose its effectiveness. Just compare this spell to Guiding Bolt - it has big range, it provides advantage and they have comparable damage; of course Guiding Bolt loses in melee range, but that's the inherent weakness of ranged attack rolls.
