# <red>cure wounds</red>

- *player's handbook*

This is the classic healing spell, but unfortunately, unless you're lower than level 3, it sucks. The reason for this is because you get access to spells that are better at healing both in- and out-of-battle.

Healing Word should be your go-to spell for in-combat healing as you can cast it as a bonus action, it doesn't require that you touch the subject and it heals just two hit points less on average.

Outside of battle, there's Prayer of Healing, which heals the same amount of damage as Cure Wounds, but you can affect multiple creatures with it, which is obviously very cost-efficient.
