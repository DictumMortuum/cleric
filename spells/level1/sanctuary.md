# sanctuary

- *player's handbook*

Are you or one of your friends surrounded by enemies but you're not high enough level to heal him effectively? Well, you can give him a get-out-of-jail-free card by casting sanctuary on the target and have him flee. Of course all of this is kinda redundant, since the subject can just get out by using the disengage action and then move, so this is only useful if you're playing on a higher initiative than your teammate and between your turns several enemies take their turns, too.

Sanctuary doesn't require concentration, so it can also be used on targets that have a support role and provide buffs to the party; for example a Lore Bard using Cutting Words.
