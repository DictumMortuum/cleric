# <blue>blindness/deafness</blue>

- *player's handbook*

A disabling spell that requires a constitution saving throw. What's great about this is that it doesn't require concentration and you can heighten it to affect more than one enemy.

Being blinded is much worse than being deafened, as subjects that have the first condition have disadvantage when attacking, but enemies attack them with advantage.
