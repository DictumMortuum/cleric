- *player's handbook*

Spiritual Weapon is probably the best thing that you can do with your bonus action in a turn for almost the entirety of your career. It stays up for a whole minute, which means that it has the potential to do 10d8 radiant damage from a second level slot, but the best thing is that it's not a concentration buff, so you can have both this and Bless up.

The bad news is that it's going to eat up your bonus action each round in order to have it to attack. Still, it's like having a bonus action attack, without having to use the attack action.
Since you are actually attacking with the weapon, then this has some synergy with spells like Divine Favor (granted by the War domain).
