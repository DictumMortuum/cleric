- *player's handbook*

Give bonus hit points to three people for 8 hours; the spell's duration isn't concentration, but unless you're finding yourself or a teammate of yours getting regularly to zero hit points, then a Prayer of Healing casting is strictly better than this - if you cast this and survive, it's just like healing 5 hit points to three allies, whereas Prayer of Healing would heal 2d8+your wisdom modifier on six allies.
