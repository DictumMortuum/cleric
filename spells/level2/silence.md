# silence

- *player's handbook*
- *concentration*

Well, Silence is kinda weird and that ritual tag makes it even weirder. It seems that somewhere along the way, the original purpose of the spell, that of being the ultimate sneaky cleric, was lost, since Silence has a verbal component, but you can't cast spells with verbal components while in the area of effect of a Silence spell, so you can't go on running and casting it without making a sound.

It does have a long range, so you can silence guards or items that can be used to alert others (e.g. bells); since no sound can pass through the area of effect, it can also be used in corridors.
Finally, the best way to use this is to keep spellcasters from doing their magic, since most spells have verbal components. If you're keeping a wizard prisoner that you don't care to question, then have him silenced.
