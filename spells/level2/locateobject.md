# locate object

- *player's handbook*
- *concentration*

This is a seriously good spell out-of-combat and you can use it in various ways. The most straightforward use would be to describe an item that you need to acquire during a particular storyline, however it could be used to track down items that have been stolen from you; its range is within 1000ft of you and you can keep concentrating on the spell for 10 minutes, which is enough time to cover a lot of ground in, for instance, a big city area.

You can also use it as an instant quest-giver when you're in a dungeon or some derelict ruins - just use your imagination and try to search for chests or whatever treasure would be stored in.
