- *player's handbook*

I love divinations like this one, mainly because it's a way to hand out information to players mechanically, so even strict dungeon masters are obliged to do it.

As a player I've regularly been in these kinds of situations, where the party agrees in a course of action which is a really bad idea, even though it doesn't seem like that. With Augury you can at least get an answer when you're having an ""oh wait, am I doing something really stupid?"" moment.

The fact that this spell has the ritual tag makes it even better - but be warned, because for each casting between long rests there's a cumulative 25 percent chance that the answer will be random.
