## <blue>acolyte</blue>

*player's handbook*

This background offers skill proficiencies in Insight and Religion that you can already pick up from your class skill list, so if you've already picked them up you have the choice of receiving two skills of your choice. The two bonus languages are a very nice addition, but this background doesn't have any tool proficiencies.

## <red>charlatan</red>

*player's handbook*

You gain proficiency with Deception and Sleight of Hand; Deception is quite good, but Sleight of Hand and the two tool proficiencies aren't that hot.

## <blue>criminal</blue>

*player's handbook*

You gain proficiency in thieves' tools, Stealth and Deception. This is a good option if you want to act as the party's rogue, as both of the offered skills are good to have and you also gain a good tool proficiency.

## <red>entertainer</red>

*player's handbook*

The only reason that you'd want this is for Acrobatics.

## <red>folk hero</red>

*player's handbook*

There is nothing much going on for a cleric here - the two skills are related to wisdom, but generally you wouldn't care for proficiency in them and the tool proficiencies are rather uninteresting.

## <navy>guild artisan</navy>

*player's handbook*

Insight and persuasion are both very good skills and if you already picked them up from your cleric skill list you are free to choose any two skills that you want. You gain access to artisan's tools and a language, but the merchant variant gives you an additional language, navigator's tools, a mule and a cart, which is a superior option.

## hermit

*player's handbook*

Religion and medicine aren't the best skills to get proficiency with, but as they appear in your cleric skill list, if you already picked them up from your cleric skill list you are free to choose any two skills that you want. Herbalist kit mentions that you can use it to create potions of healing and you also receive a bonus language of your choice.

## noble

*player's handbook*

Persuasion is good and History isn't that important, but as they appear in your cleric skill list, if you already picked them up from your cleric skill list you are free to choose any two skills that you want. The extra language is always welcome.

## outlander

*player's handbook*

You get proficiency with Athletics and Survival; there is no skill or tool proficiency overlap, so this isn't the best background, but it work if you're using strength as a combat attribute. Since Survival is related to wisdom, however, I'd prefer to not have proficiency in it and instead rely on my wisdom modifier.

## <red>sage</red>

*player's handbook*

Get proficiency in Arcana and History; you could pick them up from your cleric skill list and choose any two other skills, but Arcana and History aren't the best skills anyway, so you're better off staying away from this background. Aside from this, the two bonus languages are great.

## <blue>sailor</blue>

*player's handbook*

At last a background that offers proficiency in the perception skill! Athletics is good to have, too, especially if you have high strength. The tools are not that interesting.

## soldier

*player's handbook*

Proficiency with athletics, Intimidation and land vehicles.

## urchin

*player's handbook*

Proficiency with Sleight of Hand, Stealth and thieves' tools are the highest points of this background. It's funny that you get a pet mouse in the equipment section.
