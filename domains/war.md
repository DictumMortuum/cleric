# war domain

## <blue>domain spells</blue>

For paladins that favor a more martial playstyle, this is a quite good selection of spells. Divine Favor, Magic Weapon and Crusader's Mantle are paladin spells. Spiritual Weapon is plainly useful as it's not a concentration spell and it's always good to have it prepared.

## <navy>bonus proficiencies</navy>

You receive proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor, so there's nothing more that you could ask for.

## <blue>war priest</blue>

Get additional attacks as a bonus action, but limited to a number of times equal to your wisdom modifier. The extra attacks may be limited, but it's always nice to have options with your bonus action when using the attack option, aside from spells. Based on the abilities of the domain, it's a good idea to use a weapon with high damage dice in order to make the most out of this feature.

## <navy>channel divinity: guided strike</navy>

Spend a Channel Divinity use in order to gain a +10 on an attack roll. This ability essentially enables you to turn an important attack that would normally miss into a successful one; remember that the attack roll need not be one made with a weapon - you can turn a missed spell attack into a hit!

## <navy>channel divinity: war god's blessing</navy>

Share your Guided Strike with your teammates.

## <blue>divine strike</blue>

I view this ability as the domain's way to advance your weapon damage in a way similar to the damage upgrade of cantrips at certain levels. Since you'll most probably be using weapon attacks with this domain, as there aren't any reliable cantrips available, this ability is very useful. This is the only Divine Strike feature that you can influence its damage type, as it depends on the weapon that you're using.

Getting resistance against bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage would be a very good deal, however, it only applies to nonmagical weapons.

## tips \& tricks

Heavy armor master is a good investment if you're going to have an adventure in the apprentice tier. It will become increasingly worse as magical weapons are introduced, though. Reducing bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage by 3 is going to make you hard to kill, especially since you'll be in heavy armor, carry a shield and you'll have healing magic available.

War priest seems to bypass the loading property, because it explicitly states in the property's description that you have to fire once when you use an action, **a bonus action** or reaction to fire it. Technically, you are using an action to fire it once and then you're firing again with the bonus action spent on war priest, so it's two different activations. This means that you can use the heavy crossbow instead of the longbow, as you don't get any bonus attacks anyway aside from the war priest ability. By the way, some people may still want to go with the longbow for their ranged weapon; it's just one damage behind on average, but its range increment is better.
