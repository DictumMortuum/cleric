# trickery domain

## domain spells

The Trickery domain offers a good selection of utility and mobility spells.

## <red>blessing of the trickster</red>

This is rather lackluster - you can't use this ability on yourself, so you have to have an ally that favors stealth checks. Additionally, you can't use this on multiple teammates, as if you reuse it previous blessings automatically stop. So you can bless a single ally to gain advantage on a single skill check, as many times as you wish in the day.

## channel divinity: invoke duplicity

This could have been an interesting feature, but unfortunately it has two serious drawbacks; first, you have to use an action in order to activate it, so you can't use it in order to further your reach; second, it eats up your concentration, which narrows down the spells that you can use. At least, if you and your illusion are next to the same creature, you've got advantage on attack rolls, which is something.

## channel divinity: cloak of shadows

You can turn invisible by using your Channel Divinity; it would be a good ability to have if it wasn't activated as an action - that way you could invoke the ability and immediately gain advantage on your attack rolls - now you'll have to wait until your next turn.

## divine strike

I view this ability as the domain's way to advance your weapon damage in a way similar to the damage upgrade of cantrips at certain levels. Since you'll most probably be using weapon attacks with this domain, as there aren't any reliable cantrips available, this ability is very useful. Unfortunately, it's not that good compared to the Divine Strike that other domains get because the damage type is poison, as one whole common race (dwarves) and a common subrace (stout halflings) are resistant against poison.

## <red>improved duplicity</red>

Creating four instead of one duplicate would be awesome, but it will just increase your spell range, it won't do anything more about receiving advantage on attack rolls. It would be a lot better if your teammates could receive the advantage on their attack rolls also - at level 17 it sounds like something that you'd be normally be able to do easily.
