# Light domain

## <navy>domain spells</navy>

Now we're talking! Light domain is the one you should choose if you want flashy, direct damage spells. Scorching Ray and Fireball are all very good at the level that you're going to acquire them and they stay good for a few levels. Faerie Fire is just awesome, as advantage on attack rolls cannot be underestimated.

## bonus cantrip

Gain the Light cantrip if you don't already have it. Light is useful and someone in the party should have it, especially if not all allies have darkvision.

## <blue>warding flare</blue>

Impose disadvantage as a reaction when an opponent you can see attacks you.

I like the fact that you need to use your reaction to activate this ability, as clerics do not have much use for it, aside from opportunity attacks.

You have limited uses of this ability per day equal to your wisdom modifier, which means that you should be picky about the enemies that you use it on. On the other hand, light clerics aren't exactly fighting on the first line, so you may not be getting hit often.

## <blue>channel divinity: radiance of the dawn</blue>

Dispel magical darkness and do radiant damage in an area. I have to admit that this ability isn't exciting, but it is useful in a number of ways.

Firstly, during the apprentice tier its damage is better than most of your blasts, until you get fireball.

Until late in the expert tier, even after fireball, having two free AoE blasts per fight with respectable damage is excellent for retaining your spell slots. Later in your career, even if you don't have any remaining slots, spending an action on radiance of the dawn is still better than hitting someone with your weapon.

Lastly, it does give you a bit of utility, because you can use it to dispel magical darkness.

Technically, this ability is not a spell, so you can use this ability and also cast one that has a casting time of a bonus action (e.g. healing word). Normally, you are able to cast only one spell per round.

## <blue>improved flare</blue>

I feel that this should have been included in warding flare and this level should've featured another ability.

Chances are that you're not fighting in the front lines and you're avoiding melee combat, based on the class features that this domain offers.

This improvement to the warding flare ability is good, since you can now use it to protect allies that need it more than you do.

## <red>potent spellcasting</red>

Currently this is very bad, since the only cleric cantrip that deals damage is Sacred Flame, which does zero damage on a successful saving throw. It may become better as more sourcebooks are introduced, though.

## corona of light

Impose disadvantage on saving throws against any spell that deals fire or radiant damage within a 30ft radius.

Considering that most of your bonus domain spells are going to benefit from this feature, it's good without a doubt.

However, having said that, it feels awkward, as it requires you to spend a round activating it and a bit of positioning to get your enemies affected.

Finally, remember that corona of light may be helpful to your spellcaster allies.
