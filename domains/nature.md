# nature domain

## <blue>domain spells</blue>

Most of the options that the nature domain provides are taken from the ranger and druid lists, so your spell list is expanded quite well. Animal Friendship gets you a pet, Spike Growth has good synergy with the Thorn Whip cantrip and Plant Growth is a very good crowd-controlling tool making everyone caught in the area of effect effectively move no more than 5ft per round without a save.

## <navy>acolyte of nature</navy>

Not only you can choose a druid cantrip, but you also have the option of choosing one skill of your choice from animal handling, nature or survival. The cantrip that you're going to choose is most probably going to be Shillelagh, but Thorn Whip or Produce Flame can work, too.

## bonus proficiency

Heavy armor proficiency is very nice to have. If you don't go with strength as your combat ability (since you can use your wisdom modifier with Shillelagh), then make sure to be a dwarf or a wood elf to avoid or minimize, respectively, the fact that you lack the strength requirement of a heavy armor.

## channel divinity: charm animals and plants

This is quite similar to the original turn undead feature, so it's quite situational, but nice to have.

## <navy>dampen elements</navy>

Grant to you or to a nearby ally resistance to elemental damage as a reaction; you have virtually unlimited uses of this ability, so it's a very nice thing to possess.

## <blue>divine strike</blue>

I view this ability as the domain's way to advance your weapon damage in a way similar to the damage upgrade of cantrips at certain levels. Since you'll most probably be using weapon attacks with this domain, as there aren't any reliable cantrips available, this ability is very useful.

## <blue>master of nature</blue>

This ability largely depends on how many animals or plants you're facing, but it can be extremelly potent and single handedly turn a battle. It would be a lot better if you could get the same ability earlier, but, at least, you can affect creatures regardless of their challenge rating.
