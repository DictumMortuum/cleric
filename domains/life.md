# <navy>Life domain</navy>

## domain spells

All the spells in this list are already present in your spell list. Of course, your domain spells are always prepared and there are a few spells like bless, which you'll want in your daily repertoire, but a couple of options from another spell list would be more than welcome.

## bonus proficiency

Heavy armor proficiency is very nice to have if you choose to use strength as a combat attribute, you're a dwarf or you're a wood elf.

## <blue>disciple of life</blue>

Cure additional hit points equal to 2 + the spell's level whenever you use a spell to cure. It's good to heal an additional 3 hit points with a first level spell, but it doesn't scale that well, until you get access to mass cure spells.

## <blue>channel divinity: preserve life</blue>

Cure hit point damage with a use of your Channel Divinity. This is a good ability because not only it helps you to preserve your spell slots for something other than healing spells, but also you can quite possibly use it more than once per day, as you recover it on a short rest.

Preserve life can cure multiple allies and this is very good for the apprentice tier, because until then you can't heal more than one ally in a round - other clerics can bring back two dying allies in a single round from level 5 onwards, where they get access to mass healing word; life domain clerics can do the same from level 2 with this ability.

## <blue>blessed healer</blue>

Another ability that preserves your spells; this isn't extraordinarily good, but it can prove useful, especially in the middle of battle during low levels.

It also helps your action economy; if you are getting healed by healing others, then you won't have to spend an action to cast heal on yourself. This is very important in a combat situation, where sometimes you'll have to choose between healing an important ally and healing yourself.

At 6th level, you can use your quick action to cast a healing word to heal an ally for 1d4 + wisdom modifier + 3 (disciple of life) and yourself for 3 hit points. This may not seem like much, but just for your quick action and a first level spell, it's quite a lot damage mitigation.

I'm assuming that you are getting healed only once if you cast a mass healing spell; if your dungeon master thinks otherwise, this ability is a lot better.

## <blue>divine strike</blue>

I view this ability as the domain's way to advance your weapon damage in a way similar to the damage upgrade of cantrips at certain levels. Since you'll most probably be using weapon attacks with this domain, as there aren't any reliable cantrips available, this ability is very useful.

## <blue>supreme healing</blue>

Automatically maximize dice when healing. It's a very good ability, but at this level I suspect that it will be trivially easy to restore hit points, with maximized dice or not.

## tips \& tricks

If you get your hands on the goodberry spell (either via magic initiate or multiclassing), then your goodberries are healing for 4 hit points each, plus you won't have any need for rations, as each berry provides enough nourishment for the day. Healing 40 hit points with a first level spell (as it creates 10 berries), is a very good deal.

This is supported by the sage's ruling:

> If Iâ€™m a cleric/druid with the Disciple of Life feature, does the goodberry spell benefit from the feature?
> Yes. The Disciple of Life feature would make each berry restore 4 hit points, instead of 1, assuming you cast goodberry with a 1st-level spell slot.

Ask your DM if blessed healer works, too, if you consume a goodberry; going by strict RAW, it doesn't, as it explicitly mentions "when you cast a spell that restores hit points", however it's not that much of a stretch and this way your teammates have a way of bringing you back when you are at 0 hit points, if they don't have access to a healing spell; just have someone consume a berry and you'll be instantly be healed 3 hit points!
