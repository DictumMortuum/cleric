# tempest domain

## <blue>domain spells</blue>

The bonus spells you receive have two functions: one, you receive spells that deal lightning or thunder damage (Thunderwave, Call Lightning, Destructive Wave), on which you can spend your Destructive Wrath ability and two, some utility or blasty spells that most are not on your spell list.

## <navy>bonus proficiency</navy>

You receive proficiency with martial weapons and heavy armor, so there's nothing more that you could ask for.

## wrath of the storm

I'm kind of disappointed by this ability for a variety of reasons. First of all, the damage at low levels is quite good, but it doesn't scale, so it will quickly not be that impressive; additionally it requires a dexterity saving throw and it can only be used against creatures that are within 5ft of you - using a reach weapon renders you immune to Wrath of the Storm. The thing that bugs me the most, however, is that you kinda have to keep your armor down on purpose; you will eventually get hit regardless of your AC and buffs, but the more that you optimize your defense, the less you will be able to use this. At least you can use this on your reaction, which is always good and is activated when you get hit, which normally doesn't provoke an opportunity attack.

## <blue>channel divinity: destructive wrath</blue>

Maximize one thunder or lightning damage roll per short rest. Your domain spells already provide some spells that deal that kind of damage and it also works on Wrath of the Storm.

## thunderbolt strike

If you find a way to reliably deal lightning damage each round, then this is actually a pretty good crowd-controlling ability, as it doesn't allow a save. It has good synergy with Polearm Master and a reach weapon, since the Tempest domain already provides martial weapon proficiency. You can trigger this with your Wrath of the Storm ability, but you can also activate it each round by somehow acquiring the Shocking Grasp cantrip.

## <blue>divine strike</blue>

I view this ability as the domain's way to advance your weapon damage in a way similar to the damage upgrade of cantrips at certain levels. Since you'll most probably be using weapon attacks with this domain, as there aren't any reliable cantrips available, this ability is very useful. Too bad that the extra damage that this ability provides is thunder and not lightning - that way you'd be able to activate Thunderbolt Strike on your hits.

## <blue>stormborn</blue>

Get a flying speed whenever you're not indoors or underground. Simple and nice to have, although I'm certain that there are ways of getting a fly speed earlier if need be.

## tips \& tricks

If you are a level 2 dragonborn tempest cleric and you've chosen the electricity breath, then you can use your destructive wrath with your breath weapon once per short rest to do 12 damage. It's not much, but it's an AoE effect and you can use it as long as you keep taking short rests. At level 3 and higher, you can still use the trick, but it's best to spend your destructive wrath on shatters, which do 24 damage each.
