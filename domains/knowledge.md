# knowledge domain

## domain spells

The spells added to your spell list are OK, but nothing special - it's a mix of enchantment and divination spells.

## blessings of knowledge

Two additional languages and two additional knowledge skills. The languages are nice, but you will later have access to the tongues spell, which will make them redundant. On the other hand, your proficiency bonus for the two knowledge skills is doubled, so choose them carefully.

## <blue>channel divinity: knowledge of the ages</blue>

You can expend a channel divinity charge to gain proficiency with a skill or tool for 10 minutes. With a bit of preparation you can apply this ability to lots of different situations: if you don't have a rogue, bring some thieves' tools with you, with this skill you can disarm traps and open locks. In the same sense, you can use other kits, too, like disguise kit, forgery kit or herbalism kit, assuming that what you're doing doesn't take more than 10 minutes; for instance, you could use the herbalism kit to identify or apply herbs to a person, but not create a potion of healing.

## <blue>channel divinity: read thoughts</blue>

As an action, read the surface thoughts of a target that has failed a wisdom saving throw. Reading thoughts is potent outside of battle; however, my reasoning behind the blue grade is that you can also cast a suggestion spell for free on your affected target and he automatically fails his saving throw.

The suggestion spell is very potent and it's worth it to note that through this channel divinity ability you get some improvements: its range is now 60ft, while the spell normally has 30ft range; this is normally a 2nd level spell (a spell level that's not available on level 2).

## <red>potent spellcasting</red>

Currently this is very bad, since the only cleric cantrip that deals damage is Sacred Flame, which does zero damage on a successful saving throw. It may become better as more sourcebooks are introduced, though.

## visions of the past

This is a fluff ability and completely depends on how your dungeon master handles them.
